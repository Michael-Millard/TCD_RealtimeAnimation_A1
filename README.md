The assignment (and video below) includes a demonstration of gimbal lock using Euler angles, overcoming it using quaternions, free flying around the scene using a quaternion based camera movement, toggling between 1st and 3rd person perspectives, and modifying lighting parameters to make the scene more appealing (using IMGUI).
